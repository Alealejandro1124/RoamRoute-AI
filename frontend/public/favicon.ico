The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that represents the icon for the web application. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, I will provide a placeholder comment indicating that this file should be replaced with an actual favicon.

Here are the contents for the file:

/roamroute-ai/roamroute-ai/frontend/public/favicon.ico
<!-- This file is intentionally left blank. Please replace it with an actual favicon.ico file. -->
